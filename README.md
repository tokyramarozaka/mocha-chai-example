# An introduction to Mocha and Chai

This is just a sample of how we can use Mocha and Chai to test our code. Unit tests are marked with the `.test.js` extension to differentiate them from the actual code. To install all dependencies, just do a simple `npm i` to install all dependencies : Mocha and Chai.

# How to use this project ?

To run a test you can use the `npx mocha` command on your terminal followed by the relative path to your test file. I have also included a script short hand `npm test` to test one of the files, you can check it out in `package.json` how scripts actually work.
